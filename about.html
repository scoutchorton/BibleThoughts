			<h4>About</h4>
			Teen Bible Thoughts is a website started from scratch and authored by Caleb Horton (otherwise known as scoutchorton).
			<br />
			As a Christian, I woudl often make posts on my Facebook page relating to Christianity. These posts would include song lyrics, scripture, little thoughts, and other related posts. I found that the Facebook feed algorithms aren't geared for that kind of content, so I wanted to start my own page off to the side.
			<br/>
			As a programmer since 2013, I have learned many things. In that time, I have become familiar with HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Casscading Style Sheets), JavaScript, and Python. These languages are what power this website. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used in creating the website, while Python is used to manage posts. All code written by me can be found on the<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/scoutchorton/BibleThoughts"> Github page </a>for this project.
