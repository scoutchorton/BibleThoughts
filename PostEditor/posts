{0: ['True Enslavement?', 'Saturday, January 06, 2018', "Many people in the 21st century who aren't Christian think that to be serving a God wholeheartedly and to be a Christian is being enslaved into a system of controlling pastors and pressure from others to be \xe2\x80\x98perfect\xe2\x80\x99. They think by not being religious, they are free. But looking back, they\xe2\x80\x99re wrong. To be enslaved actually gives some freedom.<br /><br/><br />In America, there are several laws that all citizens must follow. Just think of the laws that put murders in jail or even gives them the death penalty. Do many people see this law as something that they are a slave to? Not really. This grants them freedom to live and not fear that they can be killed. Granted, there are people who disobey laws, but for the most part, these laws will keep people in line.<br /><br/><br />In Christianity, it works likewise. The closer you build a relationship to the Lord, the more you think in line with his thoughts. When you\xe2\x80\x99re in a situation where it feels like the world is trying to squeeze the life out of you, we know that we can trust in the Lord and we will come out better than we went in.<br /><br/><br />But the thing is, you have to give up your rights. The Lord sets boundaries to what he wants us to do. We give up the rights to murder, and we are protected from murder. With the Lord, we give up our own desires that go against the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s character, and you can go to the moon and back all with the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s help.<br /><br/><br />\xe2\x80\x9c34 Jesus replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you the truth, everyone who sins is a slave of sin. 35 A slave is not a permanent member of the family, but a son is part of the family forever. 36 So if the Son sets you free, you are truly free.\xe2\x80\x9d John 8:34-36 NLT<br /><br/><br />In this scripture, when you\xe2\x80\x99re adopted into God\xe2\x80\x99s house, you aren\xe2\x80\x99t a slave. You are free. You\xe2\x80\x99re not a slave to worry, because God has your life in his hands. Even if you are faced with death and it comes, you know that you will go to eternity with the Lord. As my pastor\xe2\x80\x99s famous quote goes: \xe2\x80\x9cYou can never threaten a Christian with Heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d<br /><br/><br />I hope this encourages you to realize that to become a Christian, you are free from everything that can hold you down in life, because you are a child of God, and God is for you, and would never want to see you fall."], 1: ['First Love', 'Wednesday, January 17, 2018', 'My mom watches a lot of movies on the Hallmark Channel, and whenever I\xe2\x80\x99m in the living room with her, \xe2\x80\x98love\xe2\x80\x99 is a common thing I hear. As for me, being a computer whiz (like seriously, this website was made from blank files and folders, coded by me), and a Rubik\xe2\x80\x99s cube hobbyist, romance isn\xe2\x80\x99t easy to come by. As a teenager in a public school, romance is half of what I hear about. To be honest, if I cleared out some of the knowledge of who is dating who, maybe I could finally pick up C++. Anyways, romance for me isn\xe2\x80\x99t something I would call myself an expert with.<br /><br><br />But I can say this: when you first fall in love with someone, is it some boring experience? How often do people just say \xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, guess I\xe2\x80\x99m in love again.\xe2\x80\x9d? Normally, that person is someone you cannot get off your mind. Every time they show up, they seem like the center of the universe. For most Christians, they have a similar experience when they first fall in love with Christ. All you want to do is to cry out in worship for how amazing He is, and how He has redeemed you, and all He has done for you.<br /><br><br />But in some marriages, it may seem like all love at first, but after a while, that seems to fade away. Don\xe2\x80\x99t believe me? Google \xe2\x80\x98global divorce rate\xe2\x80\x99. The United States it at a shocking 53%, while other countries around the world are even higher. People get high on that \xe2\x80\x98love at first sight\xe2\x80\x99 feeling, and when they realize that it takes time and effort to make an effective marriage, they decide to call it off. I even know a few people in my everyday life that are like that.<br /><br><br />In the Bible, there are many references to the church being the bride of Christ. In Revelation 19:7-9, it says that people who are invited to the wedding feast are blessed. Marriage is definitely a God inspired idea, because it all starts with our relationship with Him.<br /><br><br />But in this marriage, there are times where it isn\xe2\x80\x99t always right. And many times, people fall away from God because they blame this on Him. If you think it over, you\xe2\x80\x99re blaming what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in your life on the God who you just believed saved you? This isn\xe2\x80\x99t very logical, because God is perfect, and any misfortunes can\xe2\x80\x99t come from Him. Sometimes, things go on in life. They aren\xe2\x80\x99t God\xe2\x80\x99s fault.<br /><br><br />Recently in life, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been going through some rough times. Between school, home life, and just generally life, my head has been spinning in ways I don\xe2\x80\x99t want it to. But, this I know: because I am a believer in the one and only Jesus Christ, my life is in His hands, so I really don\xe2\x80\x99t have much to worry about. But how much do I believe that? Or more, how do my actions reflect that I believe that? Do I speak in a way that reflects that? Am I really in love with Christ, or am I merely going through the motions? What about what happened at the alter at summer camp?<br /><br><br />What I need to do is return to my first love. I need to drop everything and return to the point where I was so passionate for Christ, that all I could give was worship. As the Disciple song titled \xe2\x80\x98First Love\xe2\x80\x99 says, I need to give up everything that I am and surrender myself to the Lord.<br /><br><br />\xe2\x80\x9cTake me back, to the moment that we were so close, that our hearts would beat as one.\xe2\x80\x9d -Disciple, First Love<br /><br><br />If you are in a place where you think you\xe2\x80\x99re drowning in an ocean of life, just return to how it first was. Go back to where you once believed and give up everything in worship to the Lord.<br /><br><br />As for me, just keep me in your prayers that I will learn this lesson of what I\xe2\x80\x99m writing, and can return to that place where all I know is God.'], 2: ['Dead Militia (song by Disciple)', 'Monday, February 05, 2018', "I will say right out, if you don't know that I am a huge fan of Christian Rock, then you obviously don't know me too well. I will admit, I am quite a music addict. Just something about music flowing makes me happy. But today, I was listening to my Christian Rock playlist (message me if you want the Spotify link), and I suddenly felt the urge to listen to one of my favorite songs, Dead Militia. Of course, once the song I was listening to was over, I got right into that song. Midway through the song, I finally realized it's meaning.<br /><br />Earlier in the day, I was watching videos by a YouTube channel called The Bible Project, and I watched their videos about Revalations. The video talked all about the saints and the martyrs and how the seals were to be opened, and everything in Revalations.<br /><br />When I was listening to the song, it then hit me what the meaning of the song was. Dead Militia. The martyrs were asking to get revenge on the evil that killed them, but God told them to wait (Revalation 6:10-11). This was dead, who died in Christ's name, and also the army that wanted to avenge the evil, which is the milita part. The rest of the song contains references to Revalations, and honestly gives the song a deeper meaning than what I thought it was before.<br /><br />Definitely check out The Bible Project on YouTube, and Disciple's song Dead Militia on YouTube, Spotify, or whatever else you use to listen to music."], 3: ['To You I Will Adhere', 'Monday, February 12, 2018', "In English, we had to write poems. I think I am a fan of poetry, just because they are designed to flow and have meaning like music. But one of the requirements for this assignment was to have a spiritualness to the poem, so I decided to go literal and make it about a Christian who is having issues in life, but is trusting in the Lord for help. Here it is:<br /></br><br />Trying to hide<br />All the things I cry<br />About; the fear,<br />And the hurt inside.<br /><br/><br />I feel death coming near,<br />And it feels quite clear.<br />Maybe if I might,<br />To You I will adhere.<br /><br/><br />And with You I can take flight,<br />Because You are the light!<br />You guide my way,<br />All the way through the night.<br /><br/><br />And to You I pray,<br />Do not let me sway,<br />And even when I don't obey,<br />To me, You will not betray."], 4: ['In You, I Find Rest', 'Monday, February 12, 2018', 'So I decided to write another poem. I personally enjoy poetry, just how it flows and how it is like a song. So, I think I might write more poety if I feel inspired or even bored. Today, I was inspired by Psalm 23:1-2, and I wrote a poem about finding rest in the Lord.

I highly doubt that in our little town, something like this would happen, but then again, we\'ve been in the news for drugs and other stuff like that. <br /><br />But as I was listening to everyone talk about it, it inspired me to write another poem, saying that we should praise God, even in our hardships. It does directly relate to this issue, but can also relate to other issues.<br /><br />View my other poems in my Poem Book <a href="https://www.wattpad.com/story/138455392-poem-book">here</a>.<br /><br />When people mourn and cry,<br />Some might look to the sky,<br />Oh God, could you try,<br />To help when we die?<br /><br />And He replies oh my child, oh dear,<br />Please, please, have cheer!<br />I can give hope when you pull Me near.<br />Doesn\'t my Word make it clear?<br /><br />And when you\'re in a craze,<br />I say, to Me, give praise!<br />Rise up with your joyous phrase,<br />And you can be the light of your day!<br /><br />"I will exalt you, my God and King, and praise your name forever and ever.<br />I will praise you every day; yes, I will praise you forever.<br />Great is the Lord! He is most worthy of praise! No one can measure his greatness."<br /> ~ Psalm 145:1-3'], 6: ['Habakkuk', 'Thursday, March 22, 2018', "Recently, I've been watching The Bible Project's Old Testament videos about the books of the Bible. One of them, Habakkuk, interested me. The beginning seemed to resemble how Christians may think in modern America.<br /><br />\xe2\x80\x9cHow long, O Lord, must I call for help? But you do not listen! 'Violence is everywhere!' I cry, but you do not come to save. Must I forever see these evil deeds? Why must I watch all this misery? Wherever I look, I see destruction and violence. I am surrounded by people who love to argue and fight. The law has become paralyzed, and there is no justice in the courts. The wicked far outnumber the righteous, so that justice has become perverted.\xe2\x80\x9d<br />Habakkuk 1:2-4 NLT<br /><br />It seems like moral is unacceptable and immortal is acceptable. Law is perverted, and the courts approve it. Many may think that even as we pray for our schools, they still have shootings that become worse everyday. I've gotten to the point that I've been desensitized to it, and another shooting is just another shooting. That's the state of the country.<br /><br />Unlike in Habakkuk, we may not have another nation come in and take over, but we still are in a stituation where the nation isn't right. Habakkuk then asked God about why he would use another nation that is more irreverent to God to conquer Isreal. But then He says how they will have their downfall too because of their immorality.<br /><br />This reminds me of the story of Job, where he deals with 'punishment', even though he was rightous in God's eyes (Job 2:3). But, insead, this is a judgement of character, and to see how Job reacts and weather he is still reverent to God. In the end, Job humbles himself before God, and shows his reverence, and is rewarded with twice of what he had before his trials came.<br /><br />So even though that we may not see a nation come and take America over, but it shows that even while we deal with trials and stay reverent to God, we will be reawrded in the end."], 7: ['Circus for a Psycho', 'Saturday, March 24, 2018', 'I have a really quick post, which interprets a part of a song. For a while, I\'ve loved this song, but the meaning has been sort of confusing for me. This song is Circus for a Psycho, released by Skillet in their amazing 2013 album, Rise.<br /><br />This song describes what sounds like a circus, with crazy acts. But it also sounds like a battle, and some sort of attempt to be conquered, but overcoming it. I was listening to it while I was writing down thoughts for a video game concept that I\'ve had for a few years now, and I noticed a certain line which says: "Got your finger on the trigger / You think that you\xe2\x80\x99re the winner / You\xe2\x80\x99re going to get kicked off of your throne". With Easter next week, it sort of reminded me of the story of Jesus\' death and resurrection. When the pharisees thought they were doing good and removing a blasphemous teacher from the scene, and securing their own piety and reverence. But the truth is (although the Jewish may disagree), they brought Jesus\' victory over death, and get Him His place on the throne next to the Lord.<br /><br />These three lines represent the whole story. "Got your finger on the trigger" shows how the pharisees were plotting to kill Jesus, and had their fingers on a weapon that would bring death. "You think that you\'re the winner" means that they think they\'ve won, and that they succeeded to kill someone who is a \'false prophet\' of God. Then "You\'re going to get kicked off of your throne" shows how Jesus comes back victorious, and will defeat evil and corruption, and in the end, he has the final word.<br /><br />Realizing this was a shocker, especially just watching videos about the Gospels. Also, this is a Biblical hint for any who were still suspicious about Skillet\'s religiousness as a band. If there are any more scripture references in this song, I will probably make future posts about them.<br />'], 8: ['Still', 'Thursday, April 19, 2018', 'If you\'ve ever been out in nature, you would know that water is a very valuable resource. Water can also be beautiful. But picture this: sitting on the bank of a lake, looking out onto the peaceful water. But then think of a rushing river, with rapids creating a constant thrashing of water flowing downstream really fast. Vast difference, isn\'t it?<br /><br />Think of the story of Jesus, where he was on the boat and calmed the storm. "One day Jesus said to his disciples, \'Let\xe2\x80\x99s cross to the other side of the lake.\' So they got into a boat and started out. As they sailed across, Jesus settled down for a nap. But soon a fierce storm came down on the lake. The boat was filling with water, and they were in real danger. The disciples went and woke him up, shouting, \'Master, Master, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to drown!\' When Jesus woke up, he rebuked the wind and the raging waves. Suddenly the storm stopped and all was calm. Then he asked them, \'Where is your faith?\' The disciples were terrified and amazed. \'Who is this man?\' they asked each other. \'When he gives a command, even the wind and waves obey him!\'" (Luke 8:22-25 NLT)<br /><br />In this, it didn\'t take a toll on Jesus to calm the storm, he just did it. When you think about life, between work, school, sports, social media, friends, family, and leisure time, it can feel like you\'re drowning in the river I mentioned earlier; drowning in appointments, activity, social judgment, traveling, working, and constantly being busy.<br /><br />But in Jesus\' name, we can have peace, and it can all be called to still.<br /><br />The other day, I listened to the song <a href="https://genius.com/Hillsong-worship-still-lyrics">\'Still\' by Hillsong</a>, and the chorus goes like this:<br />When the oceans rise and thunders roar<br />I will soar with You above the storm<br />Father, You are King over the flood<br />I will be still, know You are God<br /><br />The disciples acknowledged that Jesus was the person who could save them, and that\'s when the storm was calmed. We aren\'t called to be caught up in the storm, but we are called to be different, and stand out and stand still, knowing that Jesus is Lord. In this, people will see this how our faith, and will be a demonstration that God is Lord above everything.<br /><br />This lesson is definitely something I need to learn, but I hope everyone can learn from this. Hope you enjoyed!']}
