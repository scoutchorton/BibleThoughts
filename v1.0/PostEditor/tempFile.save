I've written another poem. I really enjoy this poem book side-project that I'm doing. I have been suggested that I publish it, but I won't do that unless I feel that I have a book. It's not a goal, but if I get there, I definitely will publish it.

This poem is called 'Constant'. I was in worship, and I suddenly got this idea about the Lord just being the constant rock that we can stand on and know that it will never knew. If you try to follow trends, you know that they are always changing. But God is constant. He never changes. And that's what this poem is about. As always, you're welcome to view it and all the other poems in my poem book.

““ Lord, help!” they cried in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress. He calmed the storm to a whisper and stilled the waves. What a blessing was that stillness as he brought them safely into harbor! Let them praise the Lord for his great love and for the wonderful things he has done for them.”
‭‭Psalms‬ ‭107:28-31‬ ‭NLT‬‬
