I will admit, I am quite a music addict. Just something about music flowing makes me happy. But today, I was listening to my Christian Rock playlist (message me if you want the Spotify link), and I suddenly felt the urge to listen to one of my favorite songs, Dead Militia. Of course, once the song I was listening to was over, I got right into that song. Midway through the song, I finally realized it's meaning.<br /><br />Earlier in the day, I was watching videos by a YouTube channel called The Bible Project, and I watched their videos about Revalations. The video talked all about the saints and the martyrs and how the seals were to be opened, and everything in Revalations.<br /><br />When I was listening to the song, it then hit me what the meaning of the song was. Dead Militia. The martyrs were asking to get revenge on the evil that killed them, but God told them to wait (Revalation 6:10-11). This was dead, who died in Christ's name, and also the army that wanted to avenge the evil, which is the milita part. The rest of the song contains references to Revalations, and honestly gives the song a deeper meaning than what I thought it was before.<br /><br />Definitely check out The Bible Project on YouTube, and Disciple's song Dead Militia on YouTube, Spotify, or whatever else you use to listen to music.</tr><tr><td class="postsHeadings"><h2 id="1" class="postTitle">First Love</h2><h5 class="date">Wednesday, January 17, 2018</h5></td><td class="postMessage">My mom watches a lot of movies on the Hallmark Channel, and whenever I’m in the living room with her, ‘love’ is a common thing I hear. As for me, being a computer whiz (like seriously, this website was made from blank files and folders, coded by me), and a Rubik’s cube hobbyist, romance isn’t easy to come by. As a teenager in a public school, romance is half of what I hear about. To be honest, if I cleared out some of the knowledge of who is dating who, maybe I could finally pick up C++. Anyways, romance for me isn’t something I would call myself an expert with.<br /><br><br />But I can say this: when you first fall in love with someone, is it some boring experience? How often do people just say “Oh, well, guess I’m in love again.”? Normally, that person is someone you cannot get off your mind. Every time they show up, they seem like the center of the universe. For most Christians, they have a similar experience when they first fall in love with Christ. All you want to do is to cry out in worship for how amazing He is, and how He has redeemed you, and all He has done for you.<br /><br><br />But in some marriages, it may seem like all love at first, but after a while, that seems to fade away. Don’t believe me? Google ‘global divorce rate’. The United States it at a shocking 53%, while other countries around the world are even higher. People get high on that ‘love at first sight’ feeling, and when they realize that it takes time and effort to make an effective marriage, they decide to call it off. I even know a few people in my everyday life that are like that.<br /><br><br />In the Bible, there are many references to the church being the bride of Christ. In Revelation 19:7-9, it says that people who are invited to the wedding feast are blessed. Marriage is definitely a God inspired idea, because it all starts with our relationship with Him.<br /><br><br />But in this marriage, there are times where it isn’t always right. And many times, people fall away from God because they blame this on Him. If you think it over, you’re blaming what’s happening in your life on the God who you just believed saved you? This isn’t very logical, because God is perfect, and any misfortunes can’t come from Him. Sometimes, things go on in life. They aren’t God’s fault.<br /><br><br />Recently in life, I’ve been going through some rough times. Between school, home life, and just generally life, my head has been spinning in ways I don’t want it to. But, this I know: because I am a believer in the one and only Jesus Christ, my life is in His hands, so I really don’t have much to worry about. But how much do I believe that? Or more, how do my actions reflect that I believe that? Do I speak in a way that reflects that? Am I really in love with Christ, or am I merely going through the motions? What about what happened at the alter at summer camp?<br /><br><br />What I need to do is return to my first love. I need to drop everything and return to the point where I was so passionate for Christ, that all I could give was worship. As the Disciple song titled ‘First Love’ says, I need to give up everything that I am and surrender myself to the Lord.<br /><br><br />“Take me back, to the moment that we were so close, that our hearts would beat as one.” -Disciple, First Love<br /><br><br />If you are in a place where you think you’re drowning in an ocean of life, just return to how it first was. Go back to where you once believed and give up everything in worship to the Lord.<br /><br><br />As for me, just keep me in your prayers that I will learn this lesson of what I’m writing, and can return to that place where all I know is God.</tr><tr><td class="postsHeadings"><h2 id="0" class="postTitle">True Enslavement?</h2><h5 class="date">Saturday, January 06, 2018</h5></td><td class="postMessage">Many people in the 21st century who aren't Christian think that to be serving a God wholeheartedly and to be a Christian is being enslaved into a system of controlling pastors and pressure from others to be ‘perfect’. They think by not being religious, they are free. But looking back, they’re wrong. To be enslaved actually gives some freedom.<br /><br/><br />In America, there are several laws that all citizens must follow. Just think of the laws that put murders in jail or even gives them the death penalty. Do many people see this law as something that they are a slave to? Not really. This grants them freedom to live and not fear that they can be killed. Granted, there are people who disobey laws, but for the most part, these laws will keep people in line.<br /><br/><br />In Christianity, it works likewise. The closer you build a relationship to the Lord, the more you think in line with his thoughts. When you’re in a situation where it feels like the world is trying to squeeze the life out of you, we know that we can trust in the Lord and we will come out better than we went in.<br /><br/><br />But the thing is, you have to give up your rights. The Lord sets boundaries to what he wants us to do. We give up the rights to murder, and we are protected from murder. With the Lord, we give up our own desires that go against the Lord’s character, and you can go to the moon and back all with the Lord’s help.<br /><br/><br />“34 Jesus replied, “I tell you the truth, everyone who sins is a slave of sin. 35 A slave is not a permanent member of the family, but a son is part of the family forever. 36 So if the Son sets you free, you are truly free.” John 8:34-36 NLT<br /><br/><br />In this scripture, when you’re adopted into God’s house, you aren’t a slave. You are free. You’re not a slave to worry, because God has your life in his hands. Even if you are faced with death and it comes, you know that you will go to eternity with the Lord. As my pastor’s famous quote goes: “You can never threaten a Christian with Heaven.”<br /><br/><br />I hope this encourages you to realize that to become a Christian, you are free from everything that can hold you down in life, because you are a child of God, and God is for you, and would never want to see you fall.</tr></table>
