		<td class="postMessage">Many people in the 21st century who aren't Christian think that to be serving a God wholeheartedly and to be a Christian is being enslaved into a system of controlling pastors and pressure from others to be ‘perfect’. They think by not being religious, they are free. But looking back, they’re wrong. To be enslaved actually gives some freedom.<br><br><br>In America, there are several laws that all citizens must follow. Just think of the laws that put murders in jail or even gives them the death penalty. Do many people see this law as something that they are a slave to? Not really. This grants them freedom to live and not fear that they can be killed. Granted, there are people who disobey laws, but for the most part, these laws will keep people in line.<br><br><br>In Christianity, it works likewise. The closer you build a relationship to the Lord, the more you think in line with his thoughts. When you’re in a situation where it feels like the world is trying to squeeze the life out of you, we know that we can trust in the Lord and we will come out better than we went in.<br><br><br>But the thing is, you have to give up your rights. The Lord sets boundaries to what he wants us to do. We give up the rights to murder, and we are protected from murder. With the Lord, we give up our own desires that go against the Lord’s character, and you can go to the moon and back all with the Lord’s help.<br><br><br>“34 Jesus replied, “I tell you the truth, everyone who sins is a slave of sin. 35 A slave is not a permanent member of the family, but a son is part of the family forever. 36 So if the Son sets you free, you are truly free.” John 8:34-36 NLT<br><br><br>In this scripture, when you’re adopted into God’s house, you aren’t a slave. You are free. You’re not a slave to worry, because God has your life in his hands. Even if you are faced with death and it comes, you know that you will go to eternity with the Lord. As my pastor’s famous quote goes: “You can never threaten a Christian with Heaven.”<br><br><br>I hope this encourages you to realize that to become a Christian, you are free from everything that can hold you down in life, because you are a child of God, and God is for you, and would never want to see you fall.</span>
