<tr><td class="postsHeadings"><h2 id="10" class="postTitle">Blessed</h2><h5 class="date">Sunday, April 29, 2018</h5></td><td class="postMessage">We are blessed as Christians to be able to go to church every Sunday and worship God Almighty. We are blessed to serve a God who is looking out for our best interests, and not just a god who wants praise for their own glory.<br /><br />As Christians, we believe in Jesus, who sacrificed his life for us. We believe and worship not because we have to, but because we want to.<br /><br />“We love each other because he loved us first.” 1 John 4:19 NLT<br /><br />It's an honor to worship God, who first loved us, and didn't expect us to love Him first before he loved us.</tr><tr><td class="postsHeadings"><h2 id="9" class="postTitle">Spirital Warfare</h2><h5 class="date">Monday, April 23, 2018</h5></td><td class="postMessage">Last night, I was writing down some things in my notebook (that I haven't touched in a while now), and I didn't think about it at the time, but I basically signed myself into spiritual warfare.<br /><br />I used part of the Diciple song 'Game On':<br />"When the lights go up and the game is on<br />    Are you ready for me?<br />    'Cause I'm ready for you.<br />When the bell rings out this fight is on<br />    Are you ready for me?<br />    'Cause I'm ready for you!"<br /><br />Also, to close out what I wrote, I said "Get to your knees, get ready to bow.". If that isn't signing up for a spiritual warfare, I don't know what is.<br /><br />Today, I had a test I wasn't prepared for. Normally, I am never feel ready for tests in this subject (because I struggle with it), but today, I <i>wasn't</i> ready. As per usual, I prayed over the test, asked for wisdom dispite me struggling. (Now that I think about it, I normally pray over the whole class, but I forgot to do so this time. Whoops.) But as I went on and continued to star the questions I had no idea on, I got more frustrated, and by time I handed in the test, I was starting to be in tears. During the test, all I could think of was how I am slow, how I can't handle all my assignments, how I push it off as me not focusing but it probably is just me being lazy and procrastinating, and all these thoughts of worthlessness. It literally ruined my day.<br /><br />Satan doesn't want us to be happy in the Lord. We will do whatever he can to break us down so low that we won't let God reach us. Today, he tried to pull me there. But tonight, I took this all in, and I realized that I was actually under attack. My innocent writing of being ready for attack actually brought me to being attacked.<br /><br />Also, yesterday during worship at church, our amazing worship leader sang a new song (although I spent a minute trying to remember if we sang it at one of our youth worship services) called 'New Wine'by Hillsong. In the bridge, there are two lines:<br />"I lay down my old flames<br />To carry Your new fire today."<br />And when we sang these lines, I felt like I was physically holding a torch. I have no other explanation other than God working. If I had to give any interpretation, it would be either that I would carry the light of this torch into battle, like in the story of Gideon (Judges 7:20), they held torches and the LORD lead them victorious through battle. I might be wrong, but that's honestly how I felt holding this invisible torch.<br /><br />This is only the start of this. War on the enemy is declared, so he better square up, because the heat's about to get on.<br /><br />"You wanna try to take me under<br /> I'll never bow till I'm six feet under<br /> Listen to the sound of rolling thunder<br /> You can't break me<br /> You'll never take me down"<br />-Thousand Foot Krutch ~ Down</tr><tr><td class="postsHeadings"><h2 id="8" class="postTitle">Still</h2><h5 class="date">Thursday, April 19, 2018</h5></td><td class="postMessage">If you've ever been out in nature, you would know that water is a very valuable resource. Water can also be beautiful. But picture this: sitting on the bank of a lake, looking out onto the peaceful water. But then think of a rushing river, with rapids creating a constant thrashing of water flowing downstream really fast. Vast difference, isn't it?<br /><br />Think of the story of Jesus, where he was on the boat and calmed the storm. "One day Jesus said to his disciples, 'Let’s cross to the other side of the lake.' So they got into a boat and started out. As they sailed across, Jesus settled down for a nap. But soon a fierce storm came down on the lake. The boat was filling with water, and they were in real danger. The disciples went and woke him up, shouting, 'Master, Master, we’re going to drown!' When Jesus woke up, he rebuked the wind and the raging waves. Suddenly the storm stopped and all was calm. Then he asked them, 'Where is your faith?' The disciples were terrified and amazed. 'Who is this man?' they asked each other. 'When he gives a command, even the wind and waves obey him!'" (Luke 8:22-25 NLT)<br /><br />In this, it didn't take a toll on Jesus to calm the storm, he just did it. When you think about life, between work, school, sports, social media, friends, family, and leisure time, it can feel like you're drowning in the river I mentioned earlier; drowning in appointments, activity, social judgment, traveling, working, and constantly being busy.<br /><br />But in Jesus' name, we can have peace, and it can all be called to still.<br /><br />The other day, I listened to the song <a href="https://genius.com/Hillsong-worship-still-lyrics">'Still' by Hillsong</a>, and the chorus goes like this:<br />When the oceans rise and thunders roar<br />I will soar with You above the storm<br />Father, You are King over the flood<br />I will be still, know You are God<br /><br />The disciples acknowledged that Jesus was the person who could save them, and that's when the storm was calmed. We aren't called to be caught up in the storm, but we are called to be different, and stand out and stand still, knowing that Jesus is Lord. In this, people will see this how our faith, and will be a demonstration that God is Lord above everything.<br /><br />This lesson is definitely something I need to learn, but I hope everyone can learn from this. Hope you enjoyed!</tr><tr><td class="postsHeadings"><h2 id="7" class="postTitle">Circus for a Psycho</h2><h5 class="date">Saturday, March 24, 2018</h5></td><td class="postMessage">I have a really quick post, which interprets a part of a song. For a while, I've loved this song, but the meaning has been sort of confusing for me. This song is Circus for a Psycho, released by Skillet in their amazing 2013 album, Rise.<br /><br />This song describes what sounds like a circus, with crazy acts. But it also sounds like a battle, and some sort of attempt to be conquered, but overcoming it. I was listening to it while I was writing down thoughts for a video game concept that I've had for a few years now, and I noticed a certain line which says: "Got your finger on the trigger / You think that you’re the winner / You’re going to get kicked off of your throne". With Easter next week, it sort of reminded me of the story of Jesus' death and resurrection. When the pharisees thought they were doing good and removing a blasphemous teacher from the scene, and securing their own piety and reverence. But the truth is (although the Jewish may disagree), they brought Jesus' victory over death, and get Him His place on the throne next to the Lord.<br /><br />These three lines represent the whole story. "Got your finger on the trigger" shows how the pharisees were plotting to kill Jesus, and had their fingers on a weapon that would bring death. "You think that you're the winner" means that they think they've won, and that they succeeded to kill someone who is a 'false prophet' of God. Then "You're going to get kicked off of your throne" shows how Jesus comes back victorious, and will defeat evil and corruption, and in the end, he has the final word.<br /><br />Realizing this was a shocker, especially just watching videos about the Gospels. Also, this is a Biblical hint for any who were still suspicious about Skillet's religiousness as a band. If there are any more scripture references in this song, I will probably make future posts about them.<br /></tr><tr><td class="postsHeadings"><h2 id="6" class="postTitle">Habakkuk</h2><h5 class="date">Thursday, March 22, 2018</h5></td><td class="postMessage">Recently, I've been watching The Bible Project's Old Testament videos about the books of the Bible. One of them, Habakkuk, interested me. The beginning seemed to resemble how Christians may think in modern America.<br /><br />“How long, O Lord, must I call for help? But you do not listen! 'Violence is everywhere!' I cry, but you do not come to save. Must I forever see these evil deeds? Why must I watch all this misery? Wherever I look, I see destruction and violence. I am surrounded by people who love to argue and fight. The law has become paralyzed, and there is no justice in the courts. The wicked far outnumber the righteous, so that justice has become perverted.”<br />Habakkuk 1:2-4 NLT<br /><br />It seems like moral is unacceptable and immortal is acceptable. Law is perverted, and the courts approve it. Many may think that even as we pray for our schools, they still have shootings that become worse everyday. I've gotten to the point that I've been desensitized to it, and another shooting is just another shooting. That's the state of the country.<br /><br />Unlike in Habakkuk, we may not have another nation come in and take over, but we still are in a stituation where the nation isn't right. Habakkuk then asked God about why he would use another nation that is more irreverent to God to conquer Isreal. But then He says how they will have their downfall too because of their immorality.<br /><br />This reminds me of the story of Job, where he deals with 'punishment', even though he was rightous in God's eyes (Job 2:3). But, insead, this is a judgement of character, and to see how Job reacts and weather he is still reverent to God. In the end, Job humbles himself before God, and shows his reverence, and is rewarded with twice of what he had before his trials came.<br /><br />So even though that we may not see a nation come and take America over, but it shows that even while we deal with trials and stay reverent to God, we will be reawrded in the end.</tr><tr><td class="postsHeadings"><h2 id="5" class="postTitle">To Me, Give Praise!</h2><h5 class="date">Friday, February 16, 2018</h5></td><td class="postMessage">In school, it is all abuzz with talk and worry about the school shooting in Flordia this past week, and honestly, it has me worried too. I highly doubt that in our little town, something like this would happen, but then again, we've been in the news for drugs and other stuff like that. <br /><br />But as I was listening to everyone talk about it, it inspired me to write another poem, saying that we should praise God, even in our hardships. It does directly relate to this issue, but can also relate to other issues.<br /><br />View my other poems in my Poem Book <a href="https://www.wattpad.com/story/138455392-poem-book">here</a>.<br /><br />When people mourn and cry,<br />Some might look to the sky,<br />Oh God, could you try,<br />To help when we die?<br /><br />And He replies oh my child, oh dear,<br />Please, please, have cheer!<br />I can give hope when you pull Me near.<br />Doesn't my Word make it clear?<br /><br />And when you're in a craze,<br />I say, to Me, give praise!<br />Rise up with your joyous phrase,<br />And you can be the light of your day!<br /><br />"I will exalt you, my God and King, and praise your name forever and ever.<br />I will praise you every day; yes, I will praise you forever.<br />Great is the Lord!

I personally enjoy poetry, just how it flows and how it is like a song. So, I think I might write more poety if I feel inspired or even bored. Today, I was inspired by Psalm 23:1-2, and I wrote a poem about finding rest in the Lord. I am going to create a 'book' on Wattpad, and you can go there by clicking <a href="https://www.wattpad.com/story/138455392">here</a>. I hope you enjoy!<br /><br/><br />The LORD is my shepherd;<br />I have all that I need.<br />He lets me rest in green meadows;<br />he leads me beside peaceful streams.<br /> ~ Psalm 23:1-2 NLT<br /><br/><br />For you are the LORD my God,<br />You have placed me on this sod.<br />And when this earth trembles and shakes,<br />At peace You set the quakes.<br />For only Your love is the best,<br />And in You I find rest.<br /><br/><br />You shed your blood on that tree,<br />And you did it all for me!<br />In love You walked,<br />And in kindness You talked.<br />Instill in me I request,<br />Because in You I find rest.<br /><br/><br />Lord, you are my Savior.<br />Let me imitate your behavior.<br />For You have help me through my wars,<br />With your powerful, lion's roar.<br />You cleanse me of sins, like East from West,<br />Because of that, in You I find rest.<br /><br/><br />To You be the glory,<br />Let all hear your story,<br />So that when they face life's test,<br />In You, they will find rest.</tr><tr><td class="postsHeadings"><h2 id="3" class="postTitle">To You I Will Adhere</h2><h5 class="date">Monday, February 12, 2018</h5></td><td class="postMessage">In English, we had to write poems. I think I am a fan of poetry, just because they are designed to flow and have meaning like music. But one of the requirements for this assignment was to have a spiritualness to the poem, so I decided to go literal and make it about a Christian who is having issues in life, but is trusting in the Lord for help. Here it is:<br /></br><br />Trying to hide<br />All the things I cry<br />About; the fear,<br />And the hurt inside.<br /><br/><br />I feel death coming near,<br />And it feels quite clear.<br />Maybe if I might,<br />To You I will adhere.<br /><br/><br />And with You I can take flight,<br />Because You are the light!<br />You guide my way,<br />All the way through the night.<br /><br/><br />And to You I pray,<br />Do not let me sway,<br />And even when I don't obey,<br />To me, You will not betray.</tr><tr><td class="postsHeadings"><h2 id="2" class="postTitle">Dead Militia (song by Disciple)</h2><h5 class="date">Monday, February 05, 2018</h5></td><td class="postMessage">I will say right out, if you don't know that I am a huge fan of Christian Rock, then you obviously don't know me too well. I will admit, I am quite a music addict. Just something about music flowing makes me happy. But today, I was listening to my Christian Rock playlist (message me if you want the Spotify link), and I suddenly felt the urge to listen to one of my favorite songs, Dead Militia. Of course, once the song I was listening to was over, I got right into that song. Midway through the song, I finally realized it's meaning.<br /><br />Earlier in the day, I was watching videos by a YouTube channel called The Bible Project, and I watched their videos about Revalations. The video talked all about the saints and the martyrs and how the seals were to be opened, and everything in Revalations.<br /><br />When I was listening to the song, it then hit me what the meaning of the song was. Dead Militia. The martyrs were asking to get revenge on the evil that killed them, but God told them to wait (Revalation 6:10-11). This was dead, who died in Christ's name, and also the army that wanted to avenge the evil, which is the milita part. The rest of the song contains references to Revalations, and honestly gives the song a deeper meaning than what I thought it was before.<br /><br />Definitely check out The Bible Project on YouTube, and Disciple's song Dead Militia on YouTube, Spotify, or whatever else you use to listen to music.</tr><tr><td class="postsHeadings"><h2 id="1" class="postTitle">First Love</h2><h5 class="date">Wednesday, January 17, 2018</h5></td><td class="postMessage">My mom watches a lot of movies on the Hallmark Channel, and whenever I’m in the living room with her, ‘love’ is a common thing I hear. As for me, being a computer whiz (like seriously, this website was made from blank files and folders, coded by me), and a Rubik’s cube hobbyist, romance isn’t easy to come by. As a teenager in a public school, romance is half of what I hear about. To be honest, if I cleared out some of the knowledge of who is dating who, maybe I could finally pick up C++. Anyways, romance for me isn’t something I would call myself an expert with.<br /><br><br />But I can say this: when you first fall in love with someone, is it some boring experience? How often do people just say “Oh, well, guess I’m in love again.”? Normally, that person is someone you cannot get off your mind. Every time they show up, they seem like the center of the universe. For most Christians, they have a similar experience when they first fall in love with Christ. All you want to do is to cry out in worship for how amazing He is, and how He has redeemed you, and all He has done for you.<br /><br><br />But in some marriages, it may seem like all love at first, but after a while, that seems to fade away. Don’t believe me? Google ‘global divorce rate’. The United States it at a shocking 53%, while other countries around the world are even higher. People get high on that ‘love at first sight’ feeling, and when they realize that it takes time and effort to make an effective marriage, they decide to call it off. I even know a few people in my everyday life that are like that.<br /><br><br />In the Bible, there are many references to the church being the bride of Christ. In Revelation 19:7-9, it says that people who are invited to the wedding feast are blessed. Marriage is definitely a God inspired idea, because it all starts with our relationship with Him.<br /><br><br />But in this marriage, there are times where it isn’t always right. And many times, people fall away from God because they blame this on Him. If you think it over, you’re blaming what’s happening in your life on the God who you just believed saved you? This isn’t very logical, because God is perfect, and any misfortunes can’t come from Him. Sometimes, things go on in life. They aren’t God’s fault.<br /><br><br />Recently in life, I’ve been going through some rough times. Between school, home life, and just generally life, my head has been spinning in ways I don’t want it to. But, this I know: because I am a believer in the one and only Jesus Christ, my life is in His hands, so I really don’t have much to worry about. But how much do I believe that? Or more, how do my actions reflect that I believe that? Do I speak in a way that reflects that? Am I really in love with Christ, or am I merely going through the motions? What about what happened at the alter at summer camp?<br /><br><br />What I need to do is return to my first love. I need to drop everything and return to the point where I was so passionate for Christ, that all I could give was worship. As the Disciple song titled ‘First Love’ says, I need to give up everything that I am and surrender myself to the Lord.<br /><br><br />“Take me back, to the moment that we were so close, that our hearts would beat as one.” -Disciple, First Love<br /><br><br />If you are in a place where you think you’re drowning in an ocean of life, just return to how it first was. Go back to where you once believed and give up everything in worship to the Lord.<br /><br><br />As for me, just keep me in your prayers that I will learn this lesson of what I’m writing, and can return to that place where all I know is God.</tr><tr><td class="postsHeadings"><h2 id="0" class="postTitle">True Enslavement?</h2><h5 class="date">Saturday, January 06, 2018</h5></td><td class="postMessage">Many people in the 21st century who aren't Christian think that to be serving a God wholeheartedly and to be a Christian is being enslaved into a system of controlling pastors and pressure from others to be ‘perfect’. They think by not being religious, they are free. But looking back, they’re wrong. To be enslaved actually gives some freedom.<br /><br/><br />In America, there are several laws that all citizens must follow. Just think of the laws that put murders in jail or even gives them the death penalty. Do many people see this law as something that they are a slave to? Not really. This grants them freedom to live and not fear that they can be killed. Granted, there are people who disobey laws, but for the most part, these laws will keep people in line.<br /><br/><br />In Christianity, it works likewise. The closer you build a relationship to the Lord, the more you think in line with his thoughts. When you’re in a situation where it feels like the world is trying to squeeze the life out of you, we know that we can trust in the Lord and we will come out better than we went in.<br /><br/><br />But the thing is, you have to give up your rights. The Lord sets boundaries to what he wants us to do. We give up the rights to murder, and we are protected from murder. With the Lord, we give up our own desires that go against the Lord’s character, and you can go to the moon and back all with the Lord’s help.<br /><br/><br />“34 Jesus replied, “I tell you the truth, everyone who sins is a slave of sin. 35 A slave is not a permanent member of the family, but a son is part of the family forever. 36 So if the Son sets you free, you are truly free.” John 8:34-36 NLT<br /><br/><br />In this scripture, when you’re adopted into God’s house, you aren’t a slave. You are free. You’re not a slave to worry, because God has your life in his hands. Even if you are faced with death and it comes, you know that you will go to eternity with the Lord. As my pastor’s famous quote goes: “You can never threaten a Christian with Heaven.”<br /><br/><br />I hope this encourages you to realize that to become a Christian, you are free from everything that can hold you down in life, because you are a child of God, and God is for you, and would never want to see you fall.</tr></table>
